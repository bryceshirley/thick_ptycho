  abstract = {X-ray ptychography is a lensless imaging technique that visualizes the nano­structure of a thick specimen which cannot be observed with an electron microscope. It reconstructs a complex-valued refractive index of the specimen from observed diffraction patterns. This reconstruction problem is called phase retrieval ({PR}). For further improvement in the imaging capability, including expansion of the depth of field, various {PR} algorithms have been proposed. Since a high-quality {PR} method is built upon a base {PR} algorithm such as {ePIE}, developing a well performing base {PR} algorithm is important. This paper proposes an improved iterative algorithm named {CRISP}. It exploits subgradient projection which allows adaptive step size and can be expected to avoid yielding a poor image. The proposed algorithm was compared with {ePIE}, which is a simple and fast-convergence algorithm, and its modified algorithm, {rPIE}. The experiments confirmed that the proposed method improved the reconstruction performance for both simulation and real data.},

It is meant as primer and tutorial which should help to understand later chapters of this book devoted to X-ray imaging, phase contrast methods, and optical inverse problems. We start by an introduction to scalar wave propagation, first in free space, followed by propagation of short wavelength radiation within matter. This provides the basic tools to consider the mechanisms of coherent image formation in a lensless X-ray microscope. The recorded intensities are inline holograms created by self-interference behind the object. We then present single-step and iterative fixed-point techniques based on alternating projections onto constraint sets as tools to decode the measured intensities (phase retrieval). The chapter closes with a brief generalization of two dimensional coherent imaging to three dimensional imaging by tomography.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a technique to image the complex index of refraction of a sample across three dimensions. The only required hardware is a standard microscope and an array of {LEDs}. The method, termed Fourier ptychographic tomography ({FPT}), first captures a sequence of intensity-only images of a sample under angularly varying illumination. Then, using principles from ptychography and diffraction tomography, it computationally solves for the sample structure in three dimensions. The experimental microscope demonstrates a lateral spatial resolution of 0.39 μm and an axial resolution of 3.7 μm at the Nyquist–Shannon sampling limit (0.54 and 5.0 μm at the Sparrow limit, respectively) across a total imaging depth of 110 μm. Unlike competing methods, this technique quantitatively measures the volumetric refractive index of primarily transparent and contiguous sample features without the need for interferometry or any moving parts. Wide field-of-view reconstructions of thick biological specimens suggest potential applications in pathology and developmental biology.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound tomography is an emerging imaging modality that uses the transmission of ultrasound through tissue to reconstruct images of its mechanical properties. Initially, ray-based methods were used to reconstruct these images, but their inability to account for diffraction often resulted in poor resolution. Waveform inversion overcame this limitation, providing high-resolution images of the tissue. Most clinical implementations, often directed at breast cancer imaging, currently rely on a frequency-domain waveform inversion to reduce computation time. For ring arrays, ray tomography was long considered a necessary step prior to waveform inversion in order to avoid cycle skipping. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that frequency-domain waveform inversion can reliably reconstruct high-resolution images of sound speed and attenuation without relying on ray tomography to provide an initial model. We provide a detailed description of our frequency-domain waveform inversion algorithm with open-source code and data that we make publicly available.},

This paper develops a non-convex formulation of the phase retrieval problem as well as a concrete solution algorithm. In a nutshell, this algorithm starts with a careful initialization obtained by means of a spectral method, and then refines this initial estimate by iteratively applying novel update rules, which have low computational complexity, much like in a gradient descent scheme. The main contribution is that this algorithm is shown to rigorously allow the exact retrieval of phase information from a nearly minimal number of random measurements. Indeed, the sequence of successive iterates provably converges to the solution at a geometric rate so that the proposed scheme is efficient both in terms of computational and data resources. In theory, a variation on this scheme leads to a near-linear time algorithm for a physically realizable model based on coded diffraction patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methods with various experiments on image data. Underlying our analysis are insights for the analysis of non-convex optimization schemes that may have implications for computational problems beyond phase retrieval.}
